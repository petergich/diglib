 BIOGAS TREATMENT PLANT:
INNOVATIVENESS :
Biogas is relatively a mature renewable energy technology but still most commercial biogas power plants require significant resources .Local shortages of very cheap digestible feedstocks limit biogas productivity, especially for larger biogas power plants(> 1 Mwe) .Innovations could improve cost effectiveness and resource efficiency of this technology required .There have been developments around potential process innovations proposed but most are novice and not disruptive economically .The most sought after reviews systematically compare analyze and evaluate the sustainability of these emerging methods with emphasis on technological excellence and realistic commercial potential .Most household digesters operate on continuous automatic stirring modes .Often the digesters rely on electrical energy for their continuous operations which are usually mesophilic .Rarely do manually-stirred discontinuous household biogas digesters operating on hyper-thermophilic conditions exists .
The following are some of the innovative designs:
    • Construction of pyramidal-dome-shape biogas digester.
    • Introduction of pour-flush water closet (WC) toilet seats.
    • Introduction of manual stirrer in the digester.
    • Adoption of solar photovoltaic to heat the digester to a hyper-thermophilic condition.
    • Co-digestion of BW and kitchen food wastes.
1.    Construction of pyramidal-dome-shape digester.
The reactor was a modified form of a circular fixed-dome biogas digester with the circular dome modified into a pyramidal-shape roof for biogas storage. The pyramidal shape roof was done instead of the circular dome because the base of the reactor was rectangular, consequently, a pyramidal shape roof on the rectangular base would ensure airtightness . This was because the rectangular base had corners which a circular dome shape could not perfectly fit on without leakages .With pyramidal dome shape of the biogas digester fastened to the contrast.
2.   Pour-flush water closet toilet.
Two pour-flush water closet (WC) toilet seats were installed in each of the toilet unit connected to a household biogas digester .Adjoining pipes from the WC into the digester were connected using 4-inch Tee, 4-inch 45o and 4-inch 90o pipes. The influent pipe was inserted into the reactor to a depth of 450 mm above the floor of the reactor. This was done to ensure that the influent fully covered the pipe to avoid any biogas leakage through the influent pipe. An inlet pipe with a cover was also connected to the influent pipe carrying faecal materials to enhance co-digestion processes .
3.   Manual stirrer
Manual stirrer was introduced into the household biogas digester for discontinuous stirring by the users in the household. The users were educated and trained to manually stir the digester anytime they visited the toilet. In this way, it was ensured that the old and new feedstock would easily mix to enhance faster digestion. The manual stirrer with four (4) galvanised metal blades of dimensions 15 cm by 30 cm each was affixed into the household biogas digester. The rotating metal rod of the stirrer was welded into two ball bearings (one affixed to the bottom of the concrete floor of the digester and the other at the top of the metal rod just beneath the pyramidal shape) to enhance easy rotational movement when manually stirred .
4.   Installation of solar-photovoltaic for heating the digester
A high quality mono photovoltaic panel was installed on the roof of the toilet connected to the SSHTABD for heating .The photovoltaic panel was connected to a solar charge controller via solar cables .The charge controller was connected to battery series .The battery had a constant voltage charge .The battery was connected to an NP series pure sine wave inverter .
5.   Installation of galvanised copper pipes into kitchen
Galvanised copper pipes were used to connect the SSHTABD to the kitchen of the household where potential biogas to be produced was to be used. The copper pipes had diameter of 2 cm. Stop corks or valves were installed at adjoining points to regulate the flow of biogas into a biogas bag to monitor the daily biogas production. The copper pipe was laid into the walls of the restroom to the kitchen at an angle of 45o in order to ensure that all water vapour that could form during the operation of the SSHTABD would trickle down by gravity into a collection tube to be discharged.
